Webcomic aggregator scripts and web UI.  

I initially wrote my comics aggregator in 2001 or 2002, where is was a simple scraper that hit a bunch of websites and emailed the results to me.  

A new version (this one) was written in 2013.  The biggest changes were implementing administrative ability over the comics, and the ability for users to sign up and configure their own comic download.
